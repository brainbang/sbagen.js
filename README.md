# WORK IN PROGRESS

an sbagen work-alike for HTML5, nodejs, & CLI that uses an event-system so you can easily hook into speed changes & do video/audio.

## todo

- [ ] basic iDoser support for all the drg files I have (using [drg2sba](https://github.com/brainbang/drg2sba))
- [ ] add support for missing sbagen opcodes (`bell`, `wave`-stuff, `spin`, etc)
- [ ] add support for blocks
- [ ] add suport for original CLI-options (CLI, in-program, & as options to constructor)
